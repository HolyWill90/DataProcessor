# Financial Harmonizer UI Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document summarizes the key fixes applied to resolve UI issues in the Financial Harmonizer application.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. File Encoding Problems
- **Issue**: 'utf-8' codec couldn't decode certain bytes in files, causing preview errors
- **Resolution**: Implemented a robust multi-encoding fallback system in `utils.py` that tries multiple encodings when loading files

### 2. Incomplete File Processing 
- **Issue**: The file processor component didn't fully process files or show results
- **Resolution**: Enhanced `file_processor.py` with complete processing flow including file processing, results display, and export options

### 3. UI Framework Issues
- **Issue**: Inconsistent fallback mechanisms when primary UI frameworks failed
- **Resolution**: Improved the UI wrapper to provide better error handling and automatic fallbacks to alternative UI frameworks

### 4. Circular Dependencies
- **Issue**: Potential circular imports causing startup failures
- **Resolution**: Reorganized code structure and enhanced path handling to avoid circular dependencies

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Robust File Handling
Added `load_file_with_encoding_fallback()` utility function that:
- Tries multiple encodings (utf-8, latin-1, cp1252, ISO-8859-1)
- Works with both file paths and file objects (for Streamlit uploads)
- Provides detailed error reporting

### 2. Enhanced UI Wrapper
Improved `ui_wrapper.py` to:
- Better detect and initialize UI frameworks
- Provide robust fallback mechanisms
- Integrate with the fix_ui.py script when needed
- Proper debug logging for easier troubleshooting

### 3. Complete File Processing
Enhanced `file_processor.py` to:
- Handle file uploads with encoding robustness
- Process files with selected provider configuration
- Display results with data preview
- Provide export functionality

### 4. Centralized Entry Point
Enhanced `run.py` to:
- Provide consistent command-line arguments
- Support direct access to the fix_ui functionality
- Offer fallback options when issues occur
- Improve logging and error reporting

## Testing Results
The application now properly:
- Handles files with various encodings
- Processes files and shows results
- Falls back to alternative UI frameworks when needed
